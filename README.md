# XLOX Game with AI Solver

**XLOX** is an engaging puzzle game developed using Flutter, where the objective is to eliminate all cubes from the board. Players click on a cube to make it disappear, causing new cubes to appear in the four adjacent squares. If these new cubes collide with walls or other cubes, they also vanish. The game features a built-in solver utilizing various search algorithms, complemented by SFX (the package used in this project is now deprecated) and animations for an immersive experience.
